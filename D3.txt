METRIC: PM
From observing the results of the top candidates using the "Percent Match" metric, It's easy to tell that this type of metric mainly will consider the coverage of words found within the sentence to be translated. In every sentence, if the words were required to be translated, the user will find it difficult to get a good idea of the translation with PM score. 

Within the first "sentence," the candidates with the highest scores did not consider length, but matched mainly on sentences that contained integers that matched those within the string.

The second sentence, albeit an address, was difficult to find an accurate candidate for, as it would be rare to find the same exact address listed twice. Luckily, this should also lead to easy translation, as one does not normally need to translate an address to be able to find it.

The third sentence also exhibits some difficulty in finding a proper candidate, with the highest PM score only reaching 0.5. Sentences that scored the highest were perhaps of similar context to the MTBT sentence, which was about testing antipsychotic medicine on patients. Candidate sentences seemed to also mention testing on patients.

Sentence to be translated: 'The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects'

The fourth "sentence" is fairly self-explanatory, with AVAGLIM being a treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Only one other sentence mentions the treatment, presumably in the same section the MTBT sentence is mentioned. Regardless, AVAGLIM, being a treatment, does not need translation.

Sentence to be translated: 'AVAGLIM'
Translation: AVAGLIM
-----------------------------------------
1: Therefore AVAGLIM should not be used during lactation
T: Par conséquent AVAGLIM ne doit donc pas être utilisé chez la femme qui allaite
PM SCORE: 1.0

2: 103 9
T: 108 9
PM SCORE: 0.0


The fifth and final sentence also struggled finding a proper candidate. Sentences with the highest PM seemed to respond well to "medical-speak," but again lacked proper context to be able to give a good PM score.

Sentence to be translated: 'The active thiol metabolite which has been isolated in vitro binds rapidly and irreversibly to platelet receptors thus inhibiting platelet aggregation'
Translation: Le métabolite actif thiol qui a été isolé in vitro se fixe rapidement et irréversiblement aux récepteurs plaquettaires inhibant ainsi l’agrégation plaquettaire

METRIC: Sentence EDScore
From observing the results of the top candidates using the modified "Edit Distance" metric, we can infer that the metric will score higher based on context of the sentence rather than just coverage of the words within them. This is because even if a candidate has similar words to a MTBT sentence, the length the sentence will also be taken into account when calculating insertions, deletions, and substitutions for the edit distance metric.


In the first "sentence," the top candidates scored based on the optimizations of similar words versus sentence length. Each of the highest scores are attributed to a sentence length similar to that of the MTBT sentence.

In the second "sentence," we see similar types of results. Even though this exact address of a string is likely never to appear again, there are shorter versions of the address that exist which can be filled using insertions. In terms of translation, however, none will be needed due to the string being an address to begin with.

The third sentence has a bit more difficulty with ED score than the previous two due to it being a unique sentence describing the effects of antipsychotic medicines on patients. Sentences that had the highest ED score matched for similar reasons to the PM scores, such that they also described effects on patients. It is likely that the top candidates using this metric will be more useful than that of PM.

Sentence to be translated: 'The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydroaripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to young healthy subjects'

The fourth "sentence" can be considered negligible for the fact that only one substitution needs to take place on one token, therefore yielding a ED score of 0 for anything that isn't itself. AVAGLIM, being a diabetes treatment, however does not need translation regardless.

Sentence to be translated: 'AVAGLIM' 
-----------------------------------------
1: 103 9
Alignment: (*->103 1, AVAGLIM->9 1)
ED SCORE: 0

2: BATCH NUMBER
Alignment: (*->BATCH 1, AVAGLIM->NUMBER 1)
ED SCORE: 0


The final, fifth sentence has a top candidate with similarities ending at "the", "and", "in", etc. The MTBT uses unique "medical-speak" within its sentence, and therefore has little similarities to sentences stored within the TMB. This is the reason why the highest ED score is so low. Regardless, it should be a little helpful with translation for stringing together certain words.
